# Using MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Nodejs) stack to develop a website from scratch

Now that Ive published the first working version of this website, I want to take some time to go over how it all came together. 
After all writing these articles things Im building was the initialy motivation to start this website.

I choose the MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Nodejs) stack because I wanted to learn all those technologies involved.  Here is a breakdown of how 
I tacked this project:
**1)** Develop the skeleton React app locally
**2)** Develop Nodejs APIs locally using static data
**3)** Configure Mongodb locally and make Node app connect to the database
**4)** Configure docker to run the react app, node app and mongo database into individual conatainers locally
**5)** Use docker-compose to run all images together locally
**6)** Finally, use digitalocean to deploy the code on server and use docker-compose to build the images


## Part 1: Creating the React app
The source code for the React app can be found at this **[Github repo](https://github.com/codewithkaps/react-website)**. 
At a high level the react app is structured as follows: 

```
- nginx 
- public
- build
- src
   - home
   - about
   - breadcrumb
   - my-code-block
   - side-menu
   - work
   - blog
       - blog-card
       - blog-index
       - blog-item
   - footer
```

The starting point of the react app is in **index.js** where the App component is called.
```js
ReactDOM.render(
    <Router> 
        <StackContext.Provider value={state}>
            <App />
        </StackContext.Provider>
    </Router>,
    document.getElementById(root)
)
```

**App.js** contains the skeleton structure of the app. The Header and Footer components, and 
 and all the routes definition.

```js
return (
    <main class=dark:bg-gray-800 font-mono bg-white relative h-screen>
        <Header />
        <Routes>
            <Route path=/ element={<Home />} />
            <Route path=/about element={<About />} />
            <Route path=/work element={<Work />} />
            <Route path=/blog element={<Blog />}>
                <Route index=true element={<BlogIndex />} />
                <Route path=:blogId element={<BlogItem />} />
            </Route>
        </Routes>
        <Footer />
    </main>
)
```

**Part 2: Creating the Nodejs App**.
